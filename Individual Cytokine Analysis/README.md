## Demographics Analysis (Table 1)
- Calculated demographics statistics including fisher's exact and ANOVA.

## Spearman Correlations (Table 2)
- Ran Spearman rank correlation tests to determine correlation between each compartment (NLF, ELF, Sputum, Serum) stratified by smoking status. 

## Descriptive Statistics (Table S1)
- Calculated mean, median, min, max, and standard deviation for the overall cohort, non-smokers, cigarette smokers, and e-cigarette smokers by compartment.

## Cytokine Distribution Comparison (Table S2, Table S3)
- Using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests to compare baseline & cigarette smoker distributions or baseline & e-cigarette smokers by compartment (Table S2).
- Using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests to compare baseline cytokine concentrations across compartments (not in manuscript). 
- Used ANOVA test as a crude model (serving as similar function as original Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests) to compare ANCOVA results. ANCOVA was run to control for age (Table S3).
