# Cytokine Compartment Analysis
> All cytokine compartment analyses in this folder are designated by their figure number or table number in the manuscript or description of the analysis

## Descriptive Statistics (Table S1)
- Calculated mean, median, min, max, and standard deviation for the overall cohort, non-smokers, cigarette smokers, and e-cigarette smokers by compartment.

## Individual Cytokine Rankings (Table S2)
- Gave each cigarette or e-cigarette smoker a score based on the amount of deviation from baseline for each cytokine .
- Each smoker was then ranked from 1-42 with the top 5 deviators used for the 'Top Deviators Analysis (Figure 2)'.

## Top Deviators Analysis (Figure 2)
- Calculating and visualizing mean and standard deviation of smokers (either cigarette or e-cigarette smokers) that were the top 5 deviators amongst the smokers. 
- Baseline mean and standard deviation were also plotted for comparison and the plot was stratified by compartment. 

## Cytokine Distribution Comparison (Table S4)
- Using Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests to compare baseline & cigarette smoker distributions or baseline & e-cigarette smokers by compartment.

## Demographics Analysis (Table S5)
Stratified subjects based on the demographic variable of interest (race, ethnicity, sex, age, or bmi) and dichotomous strata were compared in two ways.
   1. Calculating and plotting mean and standard deivation across cytokines.
   2. Running Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests to compare cytokine concentrations distributions.
   
## Baseline Analysis (Figure 1, Table S2, and Figure S1)
- Calculating and visualizing mean and standard deviation of baseline (non-smokers) concentrations for each cytokine (Figure 1). 
- Running Shapiro-Wilk's test for normality and Spearman rank correlations tests to determine correlation between each compartment (NLF, ELF, Sputum, or Serum) at baseline (Table S2). 
- Calculating and visualizing median and standard deviation of baseline (non-smokers) concentrations for each cytokine (Figure S1).
